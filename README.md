# Spark_internship
All the work done at Spark drives and automation during the internship.

## Objectives
* To learn the process of development of a commercial product in industry.
* To work on the development of a software prototype of an IoT enabled vending machine, which enables the inventory manager to track changes in item quantity.
* To learn how different parts of hardware and software are connected in a commercial product.

## Reports
* The file "maininternship.odt" is a complete report of all the work I have done during the internship.
* The file "tutorialdoc.odt" is a how-to-do instructions of the backend to the inventory management system. The data is hosted on adafruit.com
* The file "tutorialdocUI.odt" is a how-to-do instructions of the frontend to the customer.

## Software assets
* The .jpg files are assets for the customer frontend demo.

## Python files
* The "editadafruit.py" file enables inventory management with the data hosted on adafruit.com.
* The "mainUI.py" file is the frontend displayed to the customer on a raspberry-pi, which also outputs data on the serial port of the raspberry-pi.

## Takeaways
* The internship laid a platform for further exploration into full-stack web development and microcontroller applications.
* The internship helped me learn about the stages of development of a commercial product and the importance of collaborating with colleagues in order to deliver the best work possible.
